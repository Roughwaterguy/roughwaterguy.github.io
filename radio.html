        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><a href="img/radio/20240303_201910.jpg"><img src="img/radio/20240303_201910.jpg" width="300" align="left"></a>I've always wanted to make some sort of radio transciever from random oparts. So I searched around the internet and found various circuits that seemed right to me. I then printed some off and came up with the circuit that you can see to your left. I assembled it on some perf board and... it didn't work. I really think I just need to make the power supply for everthing seperate or put it all on seperate transformer windings.</p>

        <h2>Useful software for any walkie-talkie</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><img src="img/radio/UV5R---2__23972.jpg" width="300" align="right">Recently I've been downloading a lot of mic-based software for radios. Things like Vox recorders and SSTV generating programs can really bring out new uses for all radios alike. I've had one trouble when it comes to making and receiving afsk and other digital signals. One <a href="https://jywarren.github.io/modem.js/demo.html#">website</a> has several different baud rates and modes. When it comes to actually using the website I find that my mic doesn't seem to do anything aeven when I rcord directly form my audio-out to my audio-in and attempt to play it back. I have yet to solve this problem, but, if i do I will talk further on it. Anyway, here is a <a href="img/radio/radiosoft.zip">zip file</a> with all of the software I've collected</p>
